Building OpenWrt with GitHub Actions

## Prepare

- Edit $BUILDROOT/feeds.conf.default using custom-feeds.sh
- Use custom-packages.sh to add load to $BUILDROOT/package
- Edit $BUILDROOT/.config using custom-config.sh

## Use

- Automatically trigger compilation: check the officially released Tags once a day, and trigger compilation if there are new Tags
- Manually trigger compilation: Select Build OpenWrt on the Actions page (you can enter the [Releases Tag](https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git/tags) to be used in the OpenWrt version option), and click Run Workflow

## Tips

- Before create repository to build your own firmware, you may check out if others have already built it which meet your needs by simply [search `Actions-Openwrt` in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Actions-openwrt).
- Add some meta info of your built firmware (such as firmware architecture and installed packages) to your repository introduction, this will save others' time.
