Building OpenWrt with GitHub Actions

## Prepare

- Edit `$BUILD_ROOT/feeds.conf.default` using `custom-feeds.sh`
- Use `custom-packages.sh` to add load to `$BUILD_ROOT/package`
- Edit `$BUILD_ROOT/.config` using `custom-config.sh`
- If you need to run some commands before compilation, you can add them to `prebuild-misc.sh`
- Enabling a workflow([Disabling and enabling a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow))

## Use

- Automatically trigger compilation: check the officially released Tags once a day, and trigger compilation if there are new Tags
- Manually trigger compilation: Select Build OpenWrt on the Actions page (you can enter the [Releases Tag](https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git/tags) to be used in the `OpenWrt version` option), and click Run Workflow

## Tips

- Before create repository to build your own firmware, you may check out if others have already built it which meet your needs by simply [search `Actions-Openwrt` in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Actions-openwrt).
- Add some meta info of your built firmware (such as firmware architecture and installed packages) to your repository introduction, this will save others' time.
